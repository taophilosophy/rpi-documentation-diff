== Software Utilities

=== What is on your Pico?

If you have forgotten what has been programmed into your Raspberry Pi Pico, and the program was built using our Pico C/{cpp} SDK, it will usually have a name and other useful information embedded into the binary. You can use the https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool[Picotool] command line utility to find out these details. Full instructions on how to use Picotool to do this are available in our 'https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf[getting started]' documentation.

* Go to the https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool[Picotool Github repository].

=== Debugging using another Raspberry Pi Pico

You can use one Raspberry Pi Pico to debug another Pico. This is possible via `debugprobe`, an application that allows a Pico to act as a USB â†’ SWD and UART converter.

You can find the latest release of the firmware in https://github.com/raspberrypi/debugprobe/releases/latest[the debugprobe GitHub repository].

Download `debugprobe_on_pico.uf2` from the latest release.

Push and hold the BOOTSEL button as you plug the debugger Pico into your computer to mount a volume called "RPI-RP2".

Copy `debugprobe_on_pico.uf2` onto the volume. The volume will dismount automatically after the file finishes copying onto the device.

Your Pico will reboot and now runs an updated version of the `debugprobe` firmware. It is now ready for debugging.

TIP: For instructions on how to use the debugger, see https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf[Getting Started with Pico].

=== Resetting Flash memory

Pico's BOOTSEL mode lives in read-only memory inside the RP2040 chip, and can't be overwritten accidentally. No matter what, if you hold down the BOOTSEL button when you plug in your Pico, it will appear as a drive onto which you can drag a new UF2 file. There is no way to brick the board through software. However, there are some circumstances where you might want to make sure your Flash memory is empty. You can do this by dragging and dropping a special UF2 binary onto your Pico when it is in mass storage mode.
