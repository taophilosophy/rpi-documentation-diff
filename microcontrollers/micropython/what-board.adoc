== Which hardware am I running on?

There is no direct method for software written in MicroPython to discover whether it is running on a Raspberry Pi Pico or a Pico W by looking at the hardware. However, you can tell indirectly by looking to see if network functionality is included in your particular MicroPython firmware:

[source,python]
----
import network
if hasattr(network, "WLAN"):
   # the board has WLAN capabilities
----

Alternatively, you can inspect the MicroPython firmware version to check whether it was compiled for Raspberry Pi Pico or for Pico W using the `sys` module.

[source]
----
>>> import sys
>>> sys.implementation
(name='micropython', version=(1, 19, 1), _machine='Raspberry Pi Pico W with RP2040', _mpy=4102)
----

If the 'Pico W' string is present and in `sys.implementation._machine`, your firmware was compiled for Pico W.
