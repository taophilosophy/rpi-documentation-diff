== Internal Temperature Sensor

The internal temperature sensor in the RP2040 package is a low-resolution sensor that needs to be user-calibrated to be useful to any degree of accuracy. 

A crucial part of accurately determining the temperature measured is knowing the ADC VREF voltage. The conversion formula means that small errors in the ADC VREF voltage can give quite large discrepancies in temperature calculated. The RP2040 doesn't have an internal Fixed Voltage Reference which can be used to determine VREF voltage so VREF voltage needs to be measured manually - with the caveat it could change - or an external Fixed Voltage Reference needs to be provided.

NOTE: The RP2040 sensor voltage falls as temperature rises.

See Chapter 4, section 4.9.5 of the https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf[RP2040 Datasheet] for further details of the internal temperature sensor.
