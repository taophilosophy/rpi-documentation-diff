== Technical Specification

RP2040 is the debut microcontroller from Raspberry Pi. It brings our signature values of high performance, low cost,
and ease of use to the microcontroller space.

With a large on-chip memory, symmetric dual-core processor complex, deterministic bus fabric, and rich peripheral set
augmented with our unique Programmable I/O (PIO) subsystem, it provides professional users with unrivalled power
and flexibility. With detailed documentation, a polished MicroPython port, and a UF2 bootloader in ROM, it has the
lowest possible barrier to entry for beginner and hobbyist users.

RP2040 is a stateless device, with support for cached execute-in-place from external QSPI memory. This design
decision allows you to choose the appropriate density of non-volatile storage for your application, and to benefit from
the low pricing of commodity flash parts.

RP2040 is manufactured on a modern 40nm process node, delivering high performance, low dynamic power
consumption, and low leakage, with a variety of low-power modes to support extended-duration operation on battery
power

Key features:

* Dual ARM Cortex-M0+ @ 133MHz
* 264kB on-chip SRAM in six independent banks
* Support for up to 16MB of off-chip Flash memory via dedicated QSPI bus
* DMA controller
* Fully-connected AHB crossbar
* Interpolator and integer divider peripherals
* On-chip programmable LDO to generate core voltage
* 2 on-chip PLLs to generate USB and core clocks
* 30 GPIO pins, 4 of which can be used as analogue inputs
* Peripherals
** 2 UARTs
** 2 SPI controllers
** 2 I2C controllers
** 16 PWM channels
** USB 1.1 controller and PHY, with host and device support
** 8 PIO state machines

Even in deep sleep RP2040 draws a typical current of ~180Î¼A, and sleep current is very dependent on PVT: process (current varies from chip to chip), voltage (current varies linearly with voltage), and temperature (current varies nonlinearly with temperature).

For many use cases where minimal current draw is required, the best option is to power off the system (or the RP2040 part of the system) completely if possible. This application note gives a couple of options for how this can be done, and these circuits are simple enough that a designer can adjust them for their own use case.

=== Why is the chip called RP2040?

The post-fix numeral on RP2040 comes from the following,

image::images/rp2040_explanation.svg[width=640]

. Number of processor cores (2)
. Loosely which type of processor (M0+)
. floor(log2(ram / 16k))
. floor(log2(nonvolatile / 16k)) or 0 if no onboard nonvolatile storage
