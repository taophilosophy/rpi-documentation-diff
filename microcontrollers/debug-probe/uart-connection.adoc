== Serial connections

Ensure that the Debug Probe is connected to the UART pins of your Raspberry Pi Pico.

The default pins for Raspberry Pi Pico UART0 are as follows:

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| Default UART0 | Physical Pin | GPIO Pin

| GND | 3 | N/A
| UART0_TX | 1 | GP0
| UART0_RX | 2 | GP1
|===

Once connected, traffic over the Raspberry Pi Pico's UART will be relayed to your computer by the Debug Probe and exposed as a CDC UART. On a Raspberry Pi this will show up as `/dev/ttyACM0`; on other platforms this serial port will show up differently (e.g. on macOS it will appear as `/dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX`).

If you have not already done so you should install minicom:

----
$ sudo apt install minicom
----

and open the serial port:

----
$ minicom -b 115200 -o -D /dev/ttyACM0
----

TIP: To exit `minicom`, use CTRL-A followed by X.

To test serial communication you can build and upload the "Hello World" example application. 

Change directory into the `hello_world` directory inside the `pico-examples` tree, and run `make`. Afterwards, you can upload it to your Raspberry Pi Pico using `openocd`. For a full walkthrough of building the `hello_serial` example program, see Chapter 4 of https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf[Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico].

----
$ cd pico-examples
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ export PICO_SDK_PATH=../../pico-sdk
$ cmake ..
$ cd hello_world/serial
$ make -j4
$ sudo openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/rp2040.cfg -c "adapter speed 5000" -c "program hello_serial.elf verify reset exit"
$ minicom -b 115200 -o -D /dev/ttyACM0
----

On opening `minicom` you should see "Hello, world!" printed to the console.

For terminal programs that support it, a description of the USB serial UART is advertised in the USB device description.

The unique serial number in this description means that on Windows your COM port numbering is "sticky" per device, and will allow you to write `udev` rules to associate a named device node with a particular Debug Probe.
