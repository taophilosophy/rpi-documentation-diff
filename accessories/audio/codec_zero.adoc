=== Raspberry Pi Codec Zero

Raspberry Pi Codec Zero is a Raspberry Pi Zero-sized audio HAT. It delivers bi-directional digital audio signals (I2S) between a Raspberry Pi and the Codec Zero's on-board Dialog Semiconductor DA7212 codec. The Codec Zero supports a range of input and output devices.

* High performance 24-bit audio codec
* Supports common audio sample rates between 8-96kHz
* Built in micro-electro-mechanical (MEMS) microphone (Mic2)
* Mono electret microphone (Mic2 left)
* Automatic MEMS disabling on Mic2 insert detect
* Supports additional (no fit) mono electret microphone (Mic1 right)
* Stereo auxiliary input channel (AUX IN) - PHONO/RCA connectors
* Stereo auxiliary output channel (Headphone/AUX OUT)
* Flexible analogue and digital mixing paths
* Digital signal processors (DSP) for  automatic level control (ALC)
* Five-band EQ 
* Mono line-out/mini speaker driver: 1.2W @ 5V, THD<10%, R=8Ω

The Codec Zero includes an EEPROM which can be used for auto-configuration of the Linux environment if necessary. It has an integrated MEMS microphone, and can be used with stereo microphone input via a 3.5mm socket and a mono speaker (1.2W/8Ω).

In addition to the green (GPIO23) and red (GPIO24) LEDs, a tactile programmable button (GPIO27) is also provided.
