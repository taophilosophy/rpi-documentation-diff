== Getting Started with your Keyboard

Our official keyboard includes three host USB ports for connecting external devices, such as USB mice, USB drives, and other USB- controlled devices.

The productâ€™s micro USB port is for connection to the Raspberry Pi. Via the USB hub built into the keyboard, the Raspberry Pi controls, and provides power to, the three USB Type A ports.

=== Keyboard Features

The Raspberry Pi keyboard has three lock keys: `Num Lock`, `Caps Lock`, and `Scroll Lock`. There are three LEDs in the top right-hand corner that indicate which locks are enabled.

`Scroll Lock (ScrLk)`:: Allows use of the cursor keys for browsing web pages and spreadsheets without the mouse. This mode is enabled and disabled by pressing the `ScrLk` key while holding the Fn key.
