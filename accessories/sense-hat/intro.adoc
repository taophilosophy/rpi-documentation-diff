== Introducing the Sense HAT

The https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/sense-hat/[Raspberry Pi Sense HAT] is an add-on board that gives your Raspberry Pi an array of sensing capabilities. The on-board sensors allow you to monitor pressure, humidity, temperature, colour, orientation, and movement. The bright 8Ã—8 RGB LED matrix allows you to visualise data from the sensors, and the five-button joystick lets users interact with your projects.

The Sense HAT was originally developed for use on the International Space Station, as part of the educational https://astro-pi.org/[Astro Pi] programme run by the https://raspberrypi.org[Raspberry Pi Foundation] in partnership with the https://www.esa.int/[European Space Agency]. It is well suited to many projects that require position, motion, orientation, or environmental sensing. The Sense HAT is powered by the Raspberry Pi computer to which it is connected.

An officially supported xref:sense-hat.adoc#using-the-sense-hat-with-python[Python library] provides access to all of the on-board sensors, the LED matrix, and the joystick. The Sense HAT is compatible with any Raspberry Pi computer with a 40-pin GPIO header.
