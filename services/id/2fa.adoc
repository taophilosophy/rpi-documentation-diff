== Enable Two-factor authentication

Like most modern web services, Raspberry Pi ID supports two-factor authentication (2FA) using a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password[time-based one-time password] (TOTP).

Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of protection. In addition to a password, 2FA requires another piece of information to log in. You should base this second factor on either _something you have_ (like a smart phone) or _something you are_ (like biometric information).

This guide uses your smart phone as a second factor for authentication.

TIP: Raspberry Pi ID supports macOS and iOS iCloud Keychain integration. Right click the QR code to get the "Set up verification code" option on your Mac or iPhone.

=== Install a 2FA application

First, download an app to your phone that generates TOTP. Install any 2FA app like https://authy.com/[Authy] or Google Authenticator.

=== Enable 2FA

To enable 2FA, click the **Two-factor authentication** option when signed in to your https://id.raspberrypi.com[Raspberry Pi ID].

Open the 2FA app on your phone. Scan the QR code provided by your Raspberry Pi ID with your 2FA app to begin generating tokens.

NOTE: See the documentation for your 2FA app to find out how to scan a QR code to generate a token.

Enter the six-digit TOTP generated by your 2FA app to register the 2FA app with your Raspberry Pi ID.

A confirmation screen will appear, containing a recovery code. Store the recovery code in a safe place. **This is the only way to bypass 2FA** if you lose your phone and the 2FA app.

You have now configured your Raspberry Pi ID to require 2FA. From now on, sign in requires a TOTP generated by the 2FA app on your phone.

NOTE: You can disable two-factor authentication at any point in the future at https://id.raspberrypi.com[id.raspberrypi.com].
