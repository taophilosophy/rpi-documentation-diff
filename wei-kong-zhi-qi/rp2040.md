Welcome to RP2040, a microcontroller designed here at Raspberry Pi.

![rp2040](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/images/rp2040.jpg)

Whether you have a [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html#technical-specification) or another RP2040-based microcontroller board, everything you need to get started is here. You’ll find support for getting started with [C/C++](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/c_sdk.html#sdk-setup) or [MicroPython](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html#what-is-micropython) on Raspberry Pi Pico, and links to resources for other boards that use RP2040. There are also links to the technical documentation for both the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller board and our RP2040 microcontroller chip.

## Technical Specification

Edit this [on GitHub](https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation/blob/develop/documentation/asciidoc/microcontrollers/rp2040/technical_specification.adoc)

RP2040 is the debut microcontroller from Raspberry Pi. It brings our signature values of high performance, low cost, and ease of use to the microcontroller space.

With a large on-chip memory, symmetric dual-core processor complex, deterministic bus fabric, and rich peripheral set augmented with our unique Programmable I/O (PIO) subsystem, it provides professional users with unrivalled power and flexibility. With detailed documentation, a polished MicroPython port, and a UF2 bootloader in ROM, it has the lowest possible barrier to entry for beginner and hobbyist users.

RP2040 is a stateless device, with support for cached execute-in-place from external QSPI memory. This design decision allows you to choose the appropriate density of non-volatile storage for your application, and to benefit from the low pricing of commodity flash parts.

RP2040 is manufactured on a modern 40nm process node, delivering high performance, low dynamic power consumption, and low leakage, with a variety of low-power modes to support extended-duration operation on battery power

Key features:

* Dual ARM Cortex-M0+ @ 133MHz
* 264kB on-chip SRAM in six independent banks
* Support for up to 16MB of off-chip Flash memory via dedicated QSPI bus
* DMA controller
* Fully-connected AHB crossbar
* Interpolator and integer divider peripherals
* On-chip programmable LDO to generate core voltage
* 2 on-chip PLLs to generate USB and core clocks
* 30 GPIO pins, 4 of which can be used as analogue inputs
* Peripherals

  * 2 UARTs
  * 2 SPI controllers
  * 2 I2C controllers
  * 16 PWM channels
  * USB 1.1 controller and PHY, with host and device support
  * 8 PIO state machines

Power switching RP2040 for low standby current applications

Even in deep sleep RP2040 draws a typical current of ~180μA, and sleep current is very dependent on PVT: process (current varies from chip to chip), voltage (current varies linearly with voltage), and temperature (current varies nonlinearly with temperature).

For many use cases where minimal current draw is required, the best option is to power off the system (or the RP2040 part of the system) completely if possible. This application note gives a couple of options for how this can be done, and these circuits are simple enough that a designer can adjust them for their own use case.

### Why is the chip called RP2040?

The post-fix numeral on RP2040 comes from the following,

![rp2040 explanation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/images/rp2040_explanation.svg?hash=9dee3ce29af06c85907f53920dec48be)

1. Number of processor cores (2)
2. Loosely which type of processor (M0+)
3. floor(log2(ram / 16k))
4. floor(log2(nonvolatile / 16k)) or 0 if no onboard nonvolatile storage

## Internal Temperature Sensor

Edit this [on GitHub](https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation/blob/develop/documentation/asciidoc/microcontrollers/rp2040/temp_sensor.adoc)

The internal temperature sensor in the RP2040 package is a low-resolution sensor that needs to be user-calibrated to be useful to any degree of accuracy.

A crucial part of accurately determining the temperature measured is knowing the ADC VREF voltage. The conversion formula means that small errors in the ADC VREF voltage can give quite large discrepancies in temperature calculated. The RP2040 doesn’t have an internal Fixed Voltage Reference which can be used to determine VREF voltage so VREF voltage needs to be measured manually - with the caveat it could change - or an external Fixed Voltage Reference needs to be provided.

| NOTE | The RP2040 sensor voltage falls as temperature rises. |

Designed by Raspberry Pi as both a development board, and as a reference design, the [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html) series is a family of RP2040-based boards. The Pico family currently consists of Raspberry Pi Pico (far left), Pico H (left), Pico W (right), and Pico WH (far right).

![pico family](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/images/pico_family.jpg?hash=3f928dff64ab31c4f3b1caecf4fb83a4)

The design files for Raspberry Pi Pico and Pico W are available openly, with no limitations.

### Other Boards

You can find discussions around third-party RP2040-based boards on the [Raspberry Pi forums](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewforum.php?f=147).

#### USB PIDs

Many RP2040-based devices use Raspberry Pi’s USB Vendor ID and Product ID combination. If you build a third-party board based on RP2040, you may require a unique USB Product ID (PID).

You might need a unique USB PID if you need to provide a custom driver for Windows users.

USB-IF have given Raspberry Pi permission to license USB product ID values for its Vendor ID (`0x2E8A`) for common silicon components used with RP2040.

To reserve a USB PID associated with Raspberry Pi’s vendor ID, follow the instructions in the [Raspberry Pi USB PID git repository](https://github.com/raspberrypi/usb-pid).

| NOTE | If you use the standard RP2040 PID, you can use the `iManufacturer`, `iProduct`, and `iSerial` strings to uniquely identify your device. |
