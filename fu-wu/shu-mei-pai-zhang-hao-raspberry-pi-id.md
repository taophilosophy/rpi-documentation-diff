# Raspberry Pi ID

## Create a Raspberry Pi ID

Edit this [on GitHub](https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation/blob/develop/documentation/asciidoc/services/id/signing_up.adoc)

To use Raspberry Pi services, you must first create a [Raspberry Pi ID](https://id.raspberrypi.com/).

In a browser, navigate to [id.raspberrypi.com](https://id.raspberrypi.com/).

Enter an email and password. Click the **Sign up** button to create your account.

![create account identity](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/services/images/create_account_identity.png?hash=b7d11456c6e8e284a9b5cd9b91e1de77)

Once you have created an account, you will receive a verification email.

![verify identity](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/services/images/verify_identity.png?hash=fae9bdb9ea173de1bb1175ce2eb6d51e)

Click the **Verify email** button in the email to verify your email address and complete account creation.

After creating a Raspberry Pi ID, you can log in to Raspberry Pi services using the **Sign in with Raspberry Pi ID** button.

## Enable Two-factor authentication

Edit this [on GitHub](https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation/blob/develop/documentation/asciidoc/services/id/2fa.adoc)

Like most modern web services, Raspberry Pi ID supports two-factor authentication (2FA) using a [time-based one-time password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password) (TOTP).

Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of protection. In addition to a password, 2FA requires another piece of information to log in. You should base this second factor on either *something you have* (like a smart phone) or *something you are* (like biometric information).

This guide uses your smart phone as a second factor for authentication.

| TIP | Raspberry Pi ID supports macOS and iOS iCloud Keychain integration. Right click the QR code to get the "Set up verification code" option on your Mac or iPhone. |

### Install a 2FA application

First, download an app to your phone that generates TOTP. Install any 2FA app like [Authy](https://authy.com/) or Google Authenticator.

### Enable 2FA

To enable 2FA, click the **Two-factor authentication** option when signed in to your [Raspberry Pi ID](https://id.raspberrypi.com/).

![enable 2fa](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/services/images/enable_2fa.png?hash=4d98c2191e3e389bd8a049dcb2585ca4)

Open the 2FA app on your phone. Scan the QR code provided by your Raspberry Pi ID with your 2FA app to begin generating tokens.

| NOTE | See the documentation for your 2FA app to find out how to scan a QR code to generate a token. |

![authenticate](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/services/images/authenticate.png?hash=cf3423489e85d64e8aeafd30eee67eb7)

Enter the six-digit TOTP generated by your 2FA app to register the 2FA app with your Raspberry Pi ID.

A confirmation screen will appear, containing a recovery code. Store the recovery code in a safe place. **This is the only way to bypass 2FA** if you lose your phone and the 2FA app.

![totp enabled](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/services/images/totp_enabled.png?hash=b2448ab2aa08b20103aa24050e46497a)

You have now configured your Raspberry Pi ID to require 2FA. From now on, sign in requires a TOTP generated by the 2FA app on your phone.

| NOTE | You can disable two-factor authentication at any point in the future at [id.raspberrypi.com](https://id.raspberrypi.com/). |
