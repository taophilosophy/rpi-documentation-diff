== Legacy Raspberry Pi 4 HDMI pipeline

IMPORTANT: When using the VC4 KMS graphics driver, the complete display pipeline is managed by Linux - this includes the HDMI outputs. These settings only apply to the legacy FKMS and firmware-based graphics driver.

Raspberry Pi 4 is unable to output over HDMI at 1366×768 @ 60Hz. On some monitors it is possible to configure them to use 1360×768 @ 60Hz. They do not typically advertise this mode via their EDID, so the selection can't be made automatically, but it can be selected manually by adding:

[source]
----
hdmi_group=2
hdmi_mode=87
hdmi_cvt=1360 768 60
----

...to xref:legacy_config_txt.adoc#legacy-video-options[config.txt].

Timings specified manually via a `hdmi_timings=` line in `config.txt` will also need to comply with the restriction of all horizontal timing parameters being divisible by two.

`dpi_timings=` are not restricted in the same way, as that pipeline still only runs at a single pixel per clock cycle.
