== Wire peripherals

This guide helps developers wire up peripherals to the Compute Module pins. Additionally, this guide explains how to make changes to the software to enable these peripherals.

Most of the pins of the SoC (GPIO, two CSI camera interfaces, two DSI display interfaces, HDMI, etc.) are available for wiring. You can can usually leave unused pins disconnected.

Compute Modules with the DDR2 SODIMM form factor can use any DDR2 SODIMM socket. However, the pinout is not the same as SODIMM memory modules.

To use a Compute Module, a user must design a motherboard that:

* provides power to the Compute Module (3.3V and 1.8V at minimum)
* connects the pins to the required peripherals for the user's application

Raspberry Pi's IO Boards provide the following functionality:

* powers the module
* wires the GPIO to pin headers
* wires the camera and display interfaces to FFC connectors
* wires HDMI to an HDMI port
* wires USB to USB ports
* wires activity monitoring to an 'ACT' LED
* eMMC programming over USB

This guide first explains the boot process and how Device Tree describes attached hardware.

Then, we'll explain how to attach an I2C and an SPI peripheral to an IO Board. Finally, we'll create the Device Tree files necessary to use both peripherals with Raspberry Pi OS.

=== BCM283x GPIOs

BCM283x has three banks of general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins: 28 pins on Bank 0, 18 pins on Bank 1, and 8 pins on Bank 2, for a total of 54 pins. These pins can be used as true GPIO pins: software can set them as inputs or outputs, read and/or set state, and use them as interrupts. They also can run alternate functions such as I2C, SPI, I2S, UART, SD card, and others.

You can use Bank 0 or Bank 1 on any Compute Module. Don't use Bank 2: it controls eMMC, HDMI hot plug detect, and ACT LED/USB boot control.

Use `pinctrl` to check the voltage and function of the GPIO pins to see if your Device Tree is working as expected.

=== BCM283x boot process

BCM283x devices have a VideoCore GPU and Arm CPU cores. The GPU consists of a DSP processor and hardware accelerators for imaging, video encode and decode, 3D graphics, and image compositing.

In BCM283x devices, the DSP core in the GPU boots first. It handles setup before booting up the main Arm processors.

Raspberry Pi BCM283x devices have a three-stage boot process:

* The GPU DSP comes out of reset and executes code from the small internal boot ROM. This code loads a second-stage bootloader via an external interface. This code first looks for a second-stage boot loader on the boot device called `bootcode.bin` on the boot partition. If no boot device is found or `bootcode.bin` is not found, the boot ROM waits in USB boot mode for a host to provide a second-stage boot loader (`usbbootcode.bin`).
* The second-stage boot loader is responsible for setting up the LPDDR2 SDRAM interface and other critical system functions. Once set up, the second-stage boot loader loads and executes the main GPU firmware (`start.elf`).
* `start.elf` handles additional system setup and boots up the Arm processor subsystem. It contains the GPU firmware. The GPU firmware first reads `dt-blob.bin` to determine initial GPIO pin states and GPU-specific interfaces and clocks, then parses `config.txt`. It then loads a model-specific Arm device tree file and any Device Tree overlays specified in `config.txt` before starting the Arm subsystem and passing the Device Tree data to the booting Linux kernel.

=== Device Tree

xref:configuration.adoc#device-trees-overlays-and-parameters[Linux Device Tree for Raspberry Pi] encodes information about hardware attached to a system as well as the drivers used to communicate with that hardware.

The boot partition contains several binary Device Tree (`.dtb`) files. The Device Tree compiler creates these binary files using human-readable Device Tree descriptions (`.dts`).

The boot partition contains two different types of Device Tree files. One is used by the GPU only; the rest are standard Arm Device Tree files for each of the BCM283x-based Raspberry Pi products:

* `dt-blob.bin` (used by the GPU)
* `bcm2708-rpi-b.dtb` (Used for Raspberry Pi 1 Models A and B)
* `bcm2708-rpi-b-plus.dtb` (Used for Raspberry Pi 1 Models B+ and A+)
* `bcm2709-rpi-2-b.dtb` (Used for Raspberry Pi 2 Model B)
* `bcm2710-rpi-3-b.dtb` (Used for Raspberry Pi 3 Model B)
* `bcm2708-rpi-cm.dtb` (Used for Raspberry Pi Compute Module 1)
* `bcm2710-rpi-cm3.dtb` (Used for Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3)

During boot, the user can specify a specific Arm Device Tree to use via the `device_tree` parameter in `config.txt`. For example, the line `device_tree=mydt.dtb` in `config.txt` specifies an Arm Device Tree in a file named `mydt.dtb`.

You can create a full Device Tree for a Compute Module product, but we recommend using **overlays** instead. Overlays add descriptions of non-board-specific hardware to the base Device Tree. This includes GPIO pins used and their function, as well as the devices attached, so that the correct drivers can be loaded. The bootloader merges overlays with the base Device Tree before passing the Device Tree to the Linux kernel. Occasionally the base Device Tree changes, usually in a way that will not break overlays.

Use the `dtoverlay` parameter in `config.txt` to load Device Tree overlays. Raspberry Pi OS assumes that all overlays are located in the `/overlays` directory and use the suffix `-overlay.dtb`. For example, the line `dtoverlay=myoverlay` loads the overlay `/overlays/myoverlay-overlay.dtb`.

To wire peripherals to a Compute Module, describe all hardware attached to the Bank 0 and Bank 1 GPIOs in an overlay. This allows you to use standard Raspberry Pi OS images, since the overlay is merged into the standard base Device Tree. Alternatively, you can define a custom Device Tree for your application, but you won't be able to use standard Raspberry Pi OS images. Instead, you must create a modified Raspberry Pi OS image that includes your custom device tree for every OS update you wish to distribute. If the base overlay changes, you might need to update your customised Device Tree.

=== `dt-blob.bin`

When `start.elf` runs, it first reads `dt-blob.bin`. This is a special form of Device Tree blob which tells the GPU how to set up the GPIO pin states.

`dt-blob.bin` contains information about GPIOs and peripherals controlled by the GPU, instead of the SoC. For example, the GPU manages Camera Modules. The GPU needs exclusive access to an I2C interface and a couple of pins to talk to a Camera Module.

On most Raspberry Pi models, I2C0 is reserved for exclusive GPU use. `dt-blob.bin` defines the GPIO pins used for I2C0.

By default, `dt-blob.bin` does not exist. Instead, `start.elf` includes a built-in version of the file. Many Compute Module projects provide a custom `dt-blob.bin` which overrides the default built-in file.

`dt-blob.bin` specifies:

* the pin used for HDMI hot plug detect
* GPIO pins used as a GPCLK output
* an ACT LED that the GPU can use while booting

https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/cm/minimal-cm-dt-blob.dts[`minimal-cm-dt-blob.dts`] is an example `.dts` device tree file. It sets up HDMI hot plug detection, an ACT LED, and sets all other GPIOs as inputs with default pulls.

To compile `minimal-cm-dt-blob.dts` to `dt-blob.bin`, use the xref:configuration.adoc#device-trees-overlays-and-parameters[Device Tree compiler] `dtc`.
To install `dtc` on a Raspberry Pi, run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt install device-tree-compiler
----

Then, run the follow command to compile `minimal-cm-dt-blob.dts` into `dt-blob.bin`:

[source,console]
----
$ dtc -I dts -O dtb -o dt-blob.bin minimal-cm-dt-blob.dts
----

For more information, see our xref:configuration.adoc#change-the-default-pin-configuration[guide to creating `dt-blob.bin`].

=== Arm Linux Device Tree

After `start.elf` reads `dt-blob.bin` and sets up the initial pin states and clocks, it reads xref:config_txt.adoc[`config.txt`], which contains many other options for system setup.

After reading `config.txt`, `start.elf` reads a model-specific Device Tree file. For instance, Compute Module 3 uses `bcm2710-rpi-cm.dtb`. This file is a standard Arm Linux Device Tree file that details hardware attached to the processor. It enumerates:

* what and where peripheral devices exist
* which GPIOs are used
* what functions those GPIOs have
* what physical devices are connected

This file sets up the GPIOs by overwriting the pin state in `dt-blob.bin` if it is different. It will also try to load drivers for the specific devices.

The model-specific Device Tree file contains disabled entries for peripherals. It contains no GPIO pin definitions other than the eMMC/SD Card peripheral which has GPIO defs and always uses the same pins.

=== Device Tree source and compilation

The Raspberry Pi OS image provides compiled `dtb` files, but the source `dts` files live in the https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/tree/rpi-6.6.y/arch/arm/boot/dts/broadcom[Raspberry Pi Linux kernel branch]. Look for `rpi` in the file names.

Default overlay `dts` files live at https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/tree/rpi-6.6.y/arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays[`arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays`]. These overlay files are a good starting point for creating your own overlays. To compile these `dts` files to `dtb` files, use the xref:configuration.adoc#device-trees-overlays-and-parameters[Device Tree compiler] `dtc`.

When building your own kernel, the build host requires the Device Tree compiler in `scripts/dtc`. To build your overlays automatically, add them to the `dtbs` make target in `arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/Makefile`.

=== Device Tree debugging

When booting the Linux kernel, the GPU provides a fully assembled Device Tree created using the base `dts` and any overlays. This full tree is available via the Linux `proc` interface in `/proc/device-tree`. Nodes become directories and properties become files.

You can use `dtc` to write this out as a human readable `dts` file for debugging. To see the fully assembled device tree, run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ dtc -I fs -O dts -o proc-dt.dts /proc/device-tree
----

`pinctrl` provides the status of the GPIO pins. If something seems to be going awry, try dumping the GPU log messages:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo vclog --msg
----

TIP: To include even more diagnostics in the output, add `dtdebug=1` to `config.txt`.

=== Examples

The following examples use an IO Board with peripherals attached via jumper wires. We assume a CM1+CMIO or CM3+CMIO3, running a clean install of Raspberry Pi OS Lite. The examples here require internet connectivity, so we recommend a USB hub, keyboard, and wireless LAN or Ethernet dongle plugged into the IO Board USB port.

==== Attach an I2C RTC to Bank 1 pins

In this example, we wire an NXP PCF8523 real time clock (RTC) to the IO Board Bank 1 GPIO pins: 3V3, GND, I2C1_SDA on GPIO44 and I2C1_SCL on GPIO45.

Download https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/cm/minimal-cm-dt-blob.dts[`minimal-cm-dt-blob.dts`] and copy it to the boot partition in `/boot/firmware/`.

Edit `minimal-cm-dt-blob.dts` and change the pin states of GPIO44 and 45 to be I2C1 with pull-ups:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo nano /boot/firmware/minimal-cm-dt-blob.dts
----

Replace the following lines:

[source,kotlin]
----
pin@p44 { function = "input"; termination = "pull_down"; }; // DEFAULT STATE WAS INPUT NO PULL
pin@p45 { function = "input"; termination = "pull_down"; }; // DEFAULT STATE WAS INPUT NO PULL
----

With the following pull-up definitions:

[source,kotlin]
----
pin@p44 { function = "i2c1"; termination = "pull_up"; }; // SDA1
pin@p45 { function = "i2c1"; termination = "pull_up"; }; // SCL1
----

We could use this `dt-blob.dts` with no changes, because the Linux Device Tree re-configures these pins during Linux kernel boot when the specific drivers load. However, if you configure `dt-blob.dts`, the GPIOs reach their final state as soon as possible during the GPU boot stage. In some cases, pins must be configured at GPU boot time so they are in a specific state when Linux drivers are loaded. For example, a reset line may need to be held in the correct orientation.

Run the following command to compile `dt-blob.bin`:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo dtc -I dts -O dtb -o /boot/firmware/dt-blob.bin /boot/firmware/minimal-cm-dt-blob.dts
----

Download https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/cm/example1-overlay.dts[`example1-overlay.dts`], copy it to the boot partition in `/boot/firmware/`, then compile it with the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo dtc -@ -I dts -O dtb -o /boot/firmware/overlays/example1.dtbo /boot/firmware/example1-overlay.dts
----

The `-@` flag compiles `dts` files with external references. It is usually necessary.

Add the following line to xref:../computers/config_txt.adoc#what-is-config-txt[`/boot/firmware/config.txt`]:

[source,ini]
----
dtoverlay=example1
----

Finally, reboot with `sudo reboot`.

Once rebooted, you should see an `rtc0` entry in `/dev`. Run the following command to view the hardware clock time:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo hwclock
----

==== Attach an ENC28J60 SPI Ethernet controller on Bank 0

In this example, we use an overlay already defined in `/boot/firmware/overlays` to add an ENC28J60 SPI Ethernet controller to Bank 0. The Ethernet controller uses SPI pins CE0, MISO, MOSI and SCLK (GPIO8-11 respectively), GPIO25 for a falling edge interrupt, in addition to GND and 3.3V.

In this example, we won't change `dt-blob.bin`. Instead, add the following line to `/boot/firmware/config.txt`:

[source,ini]
----
dtoverlay=enc28j60
----

Reboot with `sudo reboot`.

You should now see an `rtc0` entry in `/dev`. Run the following command to view the hardware clock time:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo hwclock
----

You should also have Ethernet connectivity. Run the following command to test your connectivity:

[source,console]
----
$ ping 8.8.8.8
----

Run the following command to show GPIO functions; GPIO8-11 should now provide ALT0 (SPI) functions:

[source,console]
----
$ pinctrl
----
