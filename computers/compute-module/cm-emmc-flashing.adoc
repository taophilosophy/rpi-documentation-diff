The Compute Module has an on-board eMMC device connected to the primary SD card interface. This guide explains how to flash (write) an operating system image to the eMMC storage of a single Compute Module.

When flashing an image to multiple Compute Modules, consider using the Compute Module Provisioner instead:

****
The Compute Module Provisioner is a web application that helps developers program many Compute Module devices simultaneously.

It provides a database of kernel images and the ability to run scripts during the flashing process, in addition to automated label printing and firmware updating.

=== Prerequisites

To flash the Compute Module eMMC, you need the following:

* Another computer, referred to in this guide as the *host device*. You can use Linux (Raspberry Pi OS or Ubuntu), Windows, or macOS.
* The Compute Module IO Board xref:compute-module.adoc#io-board-compatibility[that corresponds to your Compute Module model].
* A micro USB cable.

=== Set up the IO Board

To begin, physically set up your IO Board. This includes connecting the Compute Module and host device to the IO Board.

==== with Compute Module 4 IO Board

To set up the Compute Module 4 IO Board:

. Connect the Compute Module to the IO board. When connected, the Compute Module should lie flat.

. Fit `nRPI_BOOT` to J2 (`disable eMMC Boot`) on the IO board jumper.

. Connect a cable from micro USB slave port J11 on the IO board to the host device.

==== with Compute Module IO Board

To set up the Compute Module IO Board:

. Connect the Compute Module to the IO board. When connected, the Compute Module should lie parallel to the board, with the engagement clips firmly clicked into place.

. Set J4 (`USB SLAVE BOOT ENABLE`) to 1-2 = (`USB BOOT ENABLED`)

. Connect a cable from micro USB slave port J15 on the IO board to the host device.

=== Set up the host device

Next, let's set up software on the host device.

==== on Linux

To set up software on a Linux host device:

. Run the following command to install `rpiboot`:
+
[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt install rpiboot
----

. Connect the IO Board to power.

. Then, run `rpiboot`:
+
[source,console]
----
$ sudo rpiboot
----

. After a few seconds, the Compute Module should appear as a mass storage device. Check the `/dev/` directory, likely `/dev/sda` or `/dev/sdb`, for the device. Alternatively, run `lsblk` and search for a device with a storage capacity that matches the capacity of your Compute Module.

TIP: Alternatively, you can https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot[build `rpiboot` from source].

==== on macOS

To set up software on a macOS host device:

. First, https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot?tab=readme-ov-file#macos[build `rpiboot` from source].

. Connect the IO Board to power.

. Then, run the `rpiboot` executable with the following command:
+
[source,console]
----
$ sudo ./rpiboot
----

. When the command finishes running, you should see a message stating "The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer." Click **Ignore**. Your Compute Module should now appear as a mass storage device.

==== on Windows

To set up software on a Windows host device:

. Download the https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot/raw/master/win32/rpiboot_setup.exe[Windows installer]

. Double-click on the installer to run it. This installs the drivers and boot tool.

. Connect the IO Board to power. Windows should discover the hardware and configure the required drivers.

. Double-click on `RPiBoot.exe` to run it. After a few seconds, the Compute Module eMMC should appear as a USB mass storage device.

TIP: Alternatively, you can https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot[build `rpiboot` from source].

=== Flash the eMMC

You can use xref:../computers/getting-started.adoc#raspberry-pi-imager[Raspberry Pi Imager] to flash an operating system image to a Compute Module.

Alternatively, use `dd` to write a raw OS image (such as xref:../computers/os.adoc#introduction[Raspberry Pi OS]) to your Compute Module. Run the following command, replacing `/dev/sdX` with the path to the mass storage device representation of your Compute Module and `raw_os_image.img` with the path to your raw OS image:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo dd if=raw_os_image.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4MiB
----

Once the image has been written, disconnect and reconnect the Compute Module. You should now see two partitions (for Raspberry Pi OS):

[source,console]
----
/dev/sdX    <- Device
/dev/sdX1   <- First partition (FAT)
/dev/sdX2   <- Second partition (Linux filesystem)
----

You can mount the `/dev/sdX1` and `/dev/sdX2` partitions normally.

=== Boot from eMMC

==== with Compute Module 4 IO Board

Disconnect `nRPI_BOOT` from J2 (`disable eMMC Boot`) on the IO board jumper.

==== with Compute Module IO Board

Set J4 (`USB SLAVE BOOT ENABLE`) to 2-3 (`USB BOOT DISABLED`).

==== Boot

Disconnect the USB slave port. Power-cycle the IO board to boot the Compute Module from the new image you just wrote to eMMC.

=== Known issues

* A small percentage of CM3 experienced booting problems. We have traced these back to the method used to create the FAT32 partition; we believe the problem is due to a difference in timing between the CPU and eMMC. If you have trouble booting your CM3, create the partitions manually with the following commands:
+
[source,console]
----
$ sudo parted /dev/<device>
(parted) mkpart primary fat32 4MiB 64MiB
(parted) q
$ sudo mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/<device>
$ sudo cp -r <files>/* <mountpoint>
----

* The CM1 bootloader returns a slightly incorrect USB packet to the host. Most USB hosts ignore it, but some USB ports don't work due to this bug. CM3 fixed this bug.
