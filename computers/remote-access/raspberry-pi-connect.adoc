== Screen share with Raspberry Pi Connect

You can access the desktop of a Raspberry Pi remotely from a browser on another device using Raspberry Pi Connect. Raspberry Pi Connect handles configuration automatically, so you don't have to find your Raspberry Pi's local IP address or modify your local network.

For more information, see xref:../services/connect.adoc[the Connect documentation].
