== Remote access with Raspberry Pi Connect

You can access a Raspberry Pi remotely from a browser on another device using Raspberry Pi Connect. Connect handles configuration automatically, so you don't have to find your Raspberry Pi's local IP address, your network's public IP address, or modify your local network firewall to enable external access.

Connect includes the ability to screen share on Raspberry Pi models running the Wayland window server and remote shell (terminal) access on all Raspberry Pi models.

For more information, see xref:../services/connect.adoc[the Connect documentation].
