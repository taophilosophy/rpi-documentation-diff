== Real Time Clock (RTC)

The Raspberry Pi 5 includes an RTC module. This can be battery powered via the J5 (BAT) connector on the board located to the right of the USB-C power connector.

You can set a wake alarm which will switch the board to a very low-power state (approximately 3mA). When the alarm time is reached, the board will power back on. This can be useful for periodic jobs like time-lapse imagery.

To support the low-power mode for wake alarms, edit the bootloader configuration:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo -E rpi-eeprom-config --edit
----

adding the following two lines.

[source, bash]
----
POWER_OFF_ON_HALT=1
WAKE_ON_GPIO=0
----

You can test the functionality with:

[source,console]
----
$ echo +600 | sudo tee /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm
$ sudo halt
----

That will halt the board into a very low-power state, then wake and restart after 10 minutes.

The RTC also provides the time on boot e.g. in `dmesg`, for use cases that lack access to NTP:

[source,bash]
----
[    1.295799] rpi-rtc soc:rpi_rtc: setting system clock to 2023-08-16T15:58:50 UTC (1692201530)
----

NOTE: The RTC is still usable even when there is no backup battery attached to the J5 connector. 

=== Add a backup battery

The official battery part is a rechargeable lithium manganese coin cell, with a pre-fitted two-pin JST-SH plug and an adhesive mounting pad. This is suitable for powering the RTC when the main power supply for the board is disconnected. Since the current draw when powered down measures in single-digit ÂµA, the retention time measures in months.

NOTE: We do not recommend using a primary (non-rechargeable) lithium cell for the RTC. The RTC backup current consumption is higher than most dedicated RTC modules and will result in a short service life.

WARNING: Do not use a Lithium Ion cell for the RTC.

=== Enable battery charging

The RTC is equipped with a constant-current (3mA) constant-voltage charger.

Charging of the battery is disabled by default. There are `sysfs` files that show the charging voltage and limits:

[source,bash]
----
/sys/devices/platform/soc/soc:rpi_rtc/rtc/rtc0/charging_voltage:0
/sys/devices/platform/soc/soc:rpi_rtc/rtc/rtc0/charging_voltage_max:4400000
/sys/devices/platform/soc/soc:rpi_rtc/rtc/rtc0/charging_voltage_min:1300000
----

To charge the battery at a set voltage, add https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/blob/master/boot/overlays/README#L279[`rtc_bbat_vchg`] to `/boot/firmware/config.txt`:

[source,bash]
----
dtparam=rtc_bbat_vchg=3000000
----

Reboot with `sudo reboot` to use the new voltage setting. Check the `sysfs` files to ensure that the charging voltage was correctly set.

=== Disable battery charging

To stop charging, remove any lines that contain https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/blob/master/boot/overlays/README#L279[`rtc_bbat_vchg`] from `config.txt`.
