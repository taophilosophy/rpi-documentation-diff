== General Purpose I/O (GPIO)

General Purpose I/O (GPIO) pins can be configured as either general-purpose input, general-purpose output, or as one of up to six special alternate settings, the functions of which are pin-dependent.

There are three GPIO banks on BCM2835. Each of the three banks has its own VDD input pin. On Raspberry Pi, all GPIO banks are supplied from 3.3V. 

WARNING: Connection of a GPIO to a voltage higher than 3.3V will likely destroy the GPIO block within the SoC.

A selection of pins from Bank 0 is available on the P1 header on Raspberry Pi.

=== GPIO pads

The GPIO connections on the BCM2835 package are sometimes referred to in the peripherals data sheet as "pads" -- a semiconductor design term meaning "chip connection to outside world".

The pads are configurable CMOS push-pull output drivers/input buffers. Register-based control settings are available for:

* Internal pull-up / pull-down enable/disable
* Output xref:raspberry-pi.adoc#gpio-pads-control[drive strength]
* Input Schmitt-trigger filtering

==== Power-on states

All GPIO pins revert to general-purpose inputs on power-on reset. The default pull states are also applied, which are detailed in the alternate function table in the Arm peripherals datasheet. Most GPIOs have a default pull applied.

=== Interrupts

Each GPIO pin, when configured as a general-purpose input, can be configured as an interrupt source to the Arm. Several interrupt generation sources are configurable:

* Level-sensitive (high/low)
* Rising/falling edge
* Asynchronous rising/falling edge

Level interrupts maintain the interrupt status until the level has been cleared by system software (e.g. by servicing the attached peripheral generating the interrupt).

The normal rising/falling edge detection has a small amount of synchronisation built into the detection. At the system clock frequency, the pin is sampled with the criteria for generation of an interrupt being a stable transition within a three-cycle window, i.e. a record of 1 0 0 or 0 1 1. Asynchronous detection bypasses this synchronisation to enable the detection of very narrow events.

=== Alternative functions

Almost all of the GPIO pins have alternative functions. Peripheral blocks internal to the SoC can be selected to appear on one or more of a set of GPIO pins, for example the I2C buses can be configured to at least three separate locations. xref:raspberry-pi.adoc#gpio-pads-control[Pad control], such as drive strength or Schmitt filtering, still applies when the pin is configured as an alternate function.

=== Voltage specifications

The table below gives the various voltage specifications for the GPIO pins for BCM2835, BCM2836, BCM2837 and RP3A0-based products (e.g. Raspberry Pi Zero or Raspberry Pi 3+). For information about Compute Modules you should see the xref:compute-module.adoc#specifications[relevant datasheets].
