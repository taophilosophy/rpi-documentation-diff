== OTP register and bit definitions

All SoCs used by the Raspberry Pi range have a inbuilt one-time programmable (OTP) memory block. A few locations have factory-programmed data.

OTP memory size:

* non-BCM2712 devices: 66 32-bit values
* BCM2712 devices: 192 32-bit values

To display the contents of the OTP, run the following command:

[source,console]

$ vcgencmd otp_dump

=== OTP registers on non-BCM2712 devices

This list contains the publicly available information on the registers. If a register or bit is not defined here, then it is not public.

`16`:: OTP control register - BCM2711
+
* Bit 26: disables VC JTAG
* Bit 27: disables VC JTAG

`17`:: bootmode register
+
* Bit 1: sets the oscillator frequency to 19.2MHz
* Bit 3: enables pull ups on the SDIO pins
* Bit 15: disables ROM RSA key 0 - (secure boot enabled if set) (BCM2711)
* Bit 19: enables GPIO bootmode
* Bit 20: sets the bank to check for GPIO bootmode
* Bit 21: enables booting from SD card
* Bit 22: sets the bank to boot from
* Bit 28: enables USB device booting
* Bit 29: enables USB host booting (ethernet and mass storage)

NOTE: On BCM2711 the bootmode is defined by the xref:raspberry-pi.adoc#raspberry-pi-bootloader-configuration[bootloader EEPROM configuration] instead of OTP.

`18`:: copy of bootmode register
`28`:: serial number
`29`:: ~(serial number)
`30`:: xref:raspberry-pi.adoc#raspberry-pi-revision-codes[revision code] ^1^
`33`:: board revision extended - the meaning depends on the board model.
This is available via device-tree in `/proc/device-tree/chosen/rpi-boardrev-ext` and for testing purposes this OTP value can be temporarily overridden by setting `board_rev_ext` in `config.txt`.

* Compute Module 4
 ** Bit 30: Whether the Compute Module has a Wi-Fi module fitted
  *** 0 - Wi-Fi
  *** 1 - No Wi-Fi
 ** Bit 31: Whether the Compute Module has an EMMC module fitted
  *** 0 - EMMC
  *** 1 - No EMMC (Lite)
* Raspberry Pi 400
 ** Bits 0-7: The default keyboard country code used by https://github.com/raspberrypi-ui/piwiz[piwiz]

`36-43`:: xref:raspberry-pi.adoc#industrial-use-of-the-raspberry-pi[customer OTP values]
`45`:: MPG2 decode key
`46`:: WVC1 decode key
`47-54`:: SHA256 of RSA public key for secure-boot
`55`:: secure-boot flags (reserved for use by the bootloader)
`56-63`:: 256-bit device-specific private key
`64-65`:: MAC address; if set, system will use this in preference to the automatically generated address based on the serial number
`66`:: advanced boot register (not BCM2711)
+
* Bits 0-6: GPIO for ETH_CLK output pin
* Bit 7: enables ETH_CLK output
* Bits 8-14: GPIO for LAN_RUN output pin
* Bit 15: enables LAN_RUN output
* Bit 24: extends USB HUB timeout parameter
* Bit 25: ETH_CLK frequency:
 ** 0 - 25MHz
 ** 1 - 24MHz

^1^Also contains bits to disable overvoltage, OTP programming, and OTP reading.

=== OTP Registers on BCM2712 devices

This list contains the publicly available information on the registers. If a register or bit is not defined here, then it is not public.

`22`:: bootmode register

* Bits 2-4: Booting from SPI EEPROM (and which GPIOs)
* Bit 10: Disable booting from SD card
* Bit 11: Disable booting from SPI
* Bit 12: Disable booting from USB

`23`:: copy of bootmode register
`29`:: advanced boot mode
+
* Bits 0-7: GPIO for SD card detect
* Bits 8-15: GPIO to use for RPIBOOT

`31`:: lower 32 bits of serial number

`52-53`:: Wi-Fi MAC address
This is passed to the operating system in the Device Tree, e.g. `/proc/device-tree/axi/mmc@1100000/wifi@1/local-mac-address`

`54-55`:: Bluetooth MAC address
This is passed to the operating system in the Device Tree, e.g. `/proc/device-tree/soc/serial@7d50c000/bluetooth/local-bd-address`
