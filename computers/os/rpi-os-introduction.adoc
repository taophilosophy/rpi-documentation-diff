== Introduction

Raspberry Pi OS is a free, Debian-based operating system optimised for the Raspberry Pi hardware. Raspberry Pi OS supports over 35,000 Debian packages. We recommend Raspberry Pi OS for most Raspberry Pi use cases.

Because Raspberry Pi OS is derived from Debian, it follows a staggered version of the https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases[Debian release cycle]. Releases happen roughly every 2 years.

The latest version of Raspberry Pi OS is based on https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/bookworm-the-new-version-of-raspberry-pi-os/[Debian Bookworm]. The previous version was based on https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-os-debian-bullseye/[Debian Bullseye].
