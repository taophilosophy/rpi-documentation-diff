== Use GPIO from Python

Using the https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/[GPIO Zero] library makes it easy to control GPIO devices with Python. The library is comprehensively documented at https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/[gpiozero.readthedocs.io].

For information about GPIO hardware, see xref:../computers/raspberry-pi.adoc#gpio[GPIO hardware].

=== LED control

The following example code controls an LED connected to GPIO17:

[,python]
----
from gpiozero import LED
from time import sleep

led = LED(17)

while True:
    led.on()
    sleep(1)
    led.off()
    sleep(1)
----

Run this in an IDE like Thonny, and the LED will blink on and off repeatedly.

LED methods include `on()`, `off()`, `toggle()`, and `blink()`.

=== Read button state

The following example code reads the state of a button connected to GPIO2:

[,python]
----
from gpiozero import Button
from time import sleep

button = Button(2)

while True:
    if button.is_pressed:
        print("Pressed")
    else:
        print("Released")
    sleep(1)
----

Button functionality includes the properties `is_pressed` and `is_held`; callbacks `when_pressed`, `when_released`, and `when_held`; and methods `wait_for_press()` and `wait_for_release`.

=== Control an LED with a button

The following example code reads the state of a button connected to GPIO2, and lights an LED connected to GPIO17 when the button is pressed:

[source,python]
----
from gpiozero import LED, Button

led = LED(17)
button = Button(2)

while True:
    if button.is_pressed:
        led.on()
    else:
        led.off()
----

Alternatively:

[source,python]
----
from gpiozero import LED, Button

led = LED(17)
button = Button(2)

while True:
    button.wait_for_press()
    led.on()
    button.wait_for_release()
    led.off()
----

or:

[source,python]
----
from gpiozero import LED, Button

led = LED(17)
button = Button(2)

button.when_pressed = led.on
button.when_released = led.off
----

==== Going further

You can find more information on how to program electronics connected to your Raspberry Pi with the GPIO Zero Python library in the Raspberry Pi Press book https://github.com/raspberrypipress/released-pdfs/raw/main/simple-electronics-with-gpio-zero.pdf[Simple Electronics with GPIO Zero]. The book gets you started with the GPIO Zero library, and walks you through how to use it by building a series of projects.
