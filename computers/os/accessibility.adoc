=== Visual aids

Users of Raspberry Pi OS with visual impairments can find helpful tools in the *Recommended Software* menu.

We offer https://help.gnome.org/users/orca/stable/introduction.html.en[Orca screen reader] to ease navigation of Raspberry Pi Desktop. Additionally, we offer screen magnifier to increase the readability of UI and screen elements.

You can install Orca screen reader from the *Recommended Software* section of the main Raspberry Pi menu. Alternatively, press *Ctrl* + *Alt* + *Space* to automatically install Orca.

When booting Raspberry Pi OS for the first time after installing a new image, an automatic spoken reminder plays after 30 seconds. This reminder provides instructions on how to install Orca.
