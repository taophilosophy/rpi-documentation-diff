=== HDMI mode

To control HDMI settings, use the xref:configuration.adoc#set-resolution-and-rotation[Screen Configuration utility] or xref:configuration.adoc#set-the-kms-display-mode[KMS video settings] in `cmdline.txt`.

==== HDMI Pipeline for Raspberry Pi 4

In order to support dual displays and modes up to 4Kp60, the Raspberry Pi 4 generates 2 output pixels for every clock cycle.

Every HDMI mode has a list of timings that control all the parameters around sync pulse durations. These are typically defined via a pixel clock, and then a number of active pixels, a front porch, sync pulse, and back porch for each of the horizontal and vertical directions.

Running everything at 2 pixels per clock means that the Raspberry Pi 4 cannot support a timing where _any_ of the horizontal timings are not divisible by 2. The firmware and Linux kernel filter out any mode that does not fulfil this criteria.

There is only one incompatible mode in the CEA and DMT standards: DMT mode 81, 1366x768 @ 60Hz. This mode has odd-numbered values for the horizontal sync and back porch timings and a width that indivisible by 8.

If your monitor has this resolution, Raspberry Pi 4 automatically drops down to the next mode advertised by the monitor; typically 1280x720.

==== HDMI Pipeline for Raspberry Pi 5

While Raspberry Pi 5 also works at 2 output pixels per clock cycle, it has special handling for odd timings and can handle these modes directly.

=== Composite video mode

Composite video output can be found on each model of Raspberry Pi computer:

|===
| model | composite output

| Raspberry Pi 1 A and B
| RCA jack

| Raspberry Pi Zero
| Unpopulated `TV` header

| Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W 
| Test pads on underside of board

| Raspberry Pi 5
| J7 pad next to HDMI socket

| All other models
| 3.5mm AV jack
|===

NOTE: Composite video output is not available on Raspberry Pi 400.

==== `enable_tvout`

Set to `1` to enable composite video output and `0` to disable. On Raspberry Pi 4 and 5, composite output is only available if you set this to `1`, which also disables HDMI output. Composite output is not available on the Raspberry Pi 400.

|===
|Model
|Default

|Pi 4, 5 and 400
|0

|All other models
|1
|===

On all models except Raspberry Pi 4 and 5, HDMI output needs to be disabled in order for composite output to be enabled. HDMI output is disabled when no HDMI display is connected / detected. Set `enable_tvout=0` to prevent composite being enabled when HDMI is disabled.

To enable composite output, append `,composite` to the end of the `dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d` line in xref:../computers/config_txt.adoc#what-is-config-txt[`/boot/firmware/config.txt`]:

[source,ini]
----
dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d,composite
----

By default, this outputs composite NTSC video. To choose a different mode, instead append the following to the single line in `/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt`:

[source,ini]
----
vc4.tv_norm=<video_mode>
----

Replace the `<video_mode>` placeholder with one of the following values:

* `NTSC`
* `NTSC-J`
* `NTSC-443`
* `PAL`
* `PAL-M`
* `PAL-N`
* `PAL60`
* `SECAM`

=== LCD displays and touchscreens

==== `ignore_lcd`

By default, the Raspberry Pi Touch Display is used when detected on the I2C bus. `ignore_lcd=1` skips this detection phase. This prevents the LCD display from being used.

==== `disable_touchscreen`

Enables and disables the touchscreen.

`disable_touchscreen=1` disables the touchscreen component of the official Raspberry Pi Touch Display.

=== Generic display options

==== `disable_fw_kms_setup`

By default, the firmware parses the EDID of any HDMI attached display, picks an appropriate video mode, then passes the resolution and frame rate of the mode (and overscan parameters) to the Linux kernel via settings on the kernel command line. In rare circumstances, the firmware can choose a mode not in the EDID that may be incompatible with the device. Use `disable_fw_kms_setup=1` to disable passing video mode parameters, which can avoid this problem. The Linux video mode system (KMS) instead parses the EDID itself and picks an appropriate mode.

NOTE: On Raspberry Pi 5, this parameter defaults to `1`.
