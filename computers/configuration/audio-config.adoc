== Audio

Raspberry Pi OS has multiple audio output modes: HDMI 1, the headphone jack (if your device has one), and USB audio.

By default, Raspberry Pi OS outputs audio to HDMI 1. If no HDMI output is available, Raspberry Pi OS outputs audio to the headphone jack or a connected USB audio device.

=== Change audio output

This section explains the different methods that you can use to configure audio output in Raspberry Pi OS.

==== via the desktop volume control

Right-click the volume icon on the system tray to open the **audio output selector**. This interface lets you choose an audio output device. Click an audio output device to switch audio output to that device.

===== Pro Audio profile

You may see a device profile named Pro Audio when viewing an audio device in the audio output selector. This profile exposes the maximum number of channels across every audio device, allowing you greater control over the routing of signals. Unless you require fine-tuned control over audio output, use a different device profile.

==== via `raspi-config`

To change your audio output using xref:configuration.adoc#raspi-config[`raspi-config`], run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo raspi-config

You should see a configuration screen. Complete the following steps to change your audio output:

. Select `System options` and press `Enter`.
