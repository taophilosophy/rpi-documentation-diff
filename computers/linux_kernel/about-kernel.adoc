[[kernel]]
== Introduction

The Raspberry Pi kernel is https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux[hosted on GitHub]; updates lag behind the upstream https://github.com/torvalds/linux[Linux kernel]. The upstream kernel updates continuously, whereas Raspberry Pi integrates **long-term releases** of the Linux kernel into the Raspberry Pi kernel. We generate a `next` branch in https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/[raspberrypi/firmware] for each long-term Linux kernel release. After extensive testing and discussion, we merge each `next` branch into the main branch of our repository.

== Update

The usual Raspberry Pi OS xref:os.adoc#update-software[update process] automatically updates your kernel to the latest stable release. If you want to try the latest unstable test kernel, you can xref:os.adoc#rpi-update[manually update].
