=== Detection options

The command line options specified in this section apply only to object detection using `rpicam-detect`.

To pass one of the following options to `rpicam-detect`, prefix the option name with `--`. If the option requires a value, pass the value immediately after the option name, separated by a single space. If the value contains a space, surround the value in quotes.

Some options have shorthand aliases, for example `-h` instead of `--help`. Use these shorthand aliases instead of the full option name to save space and time at the expense of readability.

==== `object`

Detects objects with the given name, sourced from the model's label file. Accepts a plaintext file name as input.

==== `gap`

Wait at least this many frames between captures. Accepts numeric values.
